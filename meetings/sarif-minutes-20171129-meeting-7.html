<p>Michael: mentions, that as last resort for one off needs, one can always put this in the property bag</p>
<p>Luke: mentions, that implementers and users of the spec may always fall back on plain text, if markdown is deemed to insecure, but others may use markdown for emphasising, display enhancements etc.</p>

<h3 id="7.5">7.5 Begin discussions</h3>
<h4 id="7.5.1">7.5.1 Extensions to code flows</h4>
<p>Michael: summarises all three related issues shortly (cf. following subsections)</p>
<p>Michael: also kindly asks all members, having specific ideas in these regards, to please send mail to the list</p>
<p>All discuss the extensions to code flow</p>
<p>Luke and the editors will work on examples for the extensions</p>

<h5 id="7.5.1.1">7.5.1.1 Add ACL.annotations member - #30</h5>
<p><a href="https://github.com/oasis-tcs/sarif-spec/issues/30" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">https://github.com/oasis-tcs/sarif-spec/issues/30</a></p>

<h5 id="7.5.1.2">7.5.1.2 Represent exceptions in code flows - #28</h5>
<p><a href="https://github.com/oasis-tcs/sarif-spec/issues/28" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">https://github.com/oasis-tcs/sarif-spec/issues/28</a></p>

<h5 id="7.5.1.3">7.5.1.3 Should the result object support graph information? - #46</h5>
<p><a href="https://github.com/oasis-tcs/sarif-spec/issues/46" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">https://github.com/oasis-tcs/sarif-spec/issues/46</a></p>

<h4 id="7.5.2">7.5.2 Consider restructuring SARIF to be location, not results-focused - #55</h4>
<p><a href="https://github.com/oasis-tcs/sarif-spec/issues/55" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">https://github.com/oasis-tcs/sarif-spec/issues/55</a></p>
<p>Michael: summarises the issue</p>
<p>All discuss the issue and strong feelings about the proposal</p>
<p>Stefan: suggests to somehow suggest ordering hints in or aside of the spec</p>
<p>Laurence: takes the action to file an issue.</p>
<p>Stefan: suggests that this could also become a nonstandard track note async produced thus not slowing down the main spec</p>
<p>Nikolai; suggests some language / patterns as accepted by a community he is engaged with</p>
<p>Stefan: Knowledge discovery metamodel - Representation of datatypes in KDM is aligned with ISO standard ISO/IEC 11404 (see also General Purpose Datatypes).</p>
<p>All discuss that a tabled idea has already been implemented in the ISO standard ISO/IEC 11404 note from wikipedia:</p>
<blockquote>ISO/IEC 11404, General Purpose Datatypes (GPD), are a collection of datatypes defined independently of any particular programming language or implementation. These datatypes can be used to describe interfaces to existing libraries without having to specify the language (such as Fortran or C).<br>
The first edition of this standard was published in 1996 under the title "Language-independent datatypes". The standard was revised by the responsible ISO sub-committee (JTC1/SC22 - Information Technology - Programming languages). The revised version has the new title "General Purpose Datatypes".</blockquote>
<p>Stefan: Freely available from ISO under the usual license agreement: http://standards.iso.org/ittf/PubliclyAvailableStandards/c039479_ISO_IEC_11404_2007(E).zip</p>
<p>Michael: mentions that one could get back on BSON for random access support as another scenario for efficient access to SARIF files</p>

<h4 id="7.5.3">7.5.3 Consider a tool validation or 'selectivity' annotation - #59</h4>
<p><a href="https://github.com/oasis-tcs/sarif-spec/issues/59" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">https://github.com/oasis-tcs/sarif-spec/issues/59</a></p>
