<h2 id="7">7. Adopt Driving Principles</h2>
<h3 id="7.1">7.1 Discuss what principles will guide the work</h3>
<p>Discussion began at the previous meeting. </p>
<p>A summary of the results is in the SARIF TC's github issue #1 for consideration at this meeting. <a href="https://github.com/oasis-tcs/sarif-spec/issues/1" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">https://github.com/oasis-tcs/sarif-spec/issues/1</a></p>
<p>If a motion is made to adopt the principles as amended, consider the motion.</p>
<p>All look at the latest document referenced from this issue / pull request: <a href="https://github.com/oasis-tcs/sarif-spec/pull/45/files" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">https://github.com/oasis-tcs/sarif-spec/pull/45/files</a></p>
<p>Laurence: Asks, if not supporting LifeCycle removal of existing properties is planned/intended</p>
<p>Michael: No, not intended. He suggests to identify any tipping point to not get pulled into divergent topics, but to describe enough to expose sufficient context (finding a balance to allow basics, but focus on obvious and essential). BaselineId is such a key minimal data allowing a post processing tool to continue</p>
<p>Paul: suggests that item 7 should be modified</p>
<p>Michael agrees, that there is some loss, not supporting all possible result structures and use cases (like JIRA integration use case mentioned by Paul)</p>
<p>Stefan: Discussed document provided as service to the reader here:</p>
<blockquote>
<ol>
<li>The primary purpose of SARIF is to enable low cost development of rich functionality (viewers, work item filers, etc.) that operates against a broad range of SARIF producers. A key design principle for all SARIF properties, therefore, is that any proposed data should be clearly useful in a consumption scenario.</li>
<li>As an important but secondary concern, SARIF is designed to allow the output of existing tools to be normalized to a common format. In order to support the ability for consumers to process, display, etc., this information in an appropriate and consistent way, it must be possible to normalize any proposed SARIF data to a common form.</li>
<li>The SARIF format specification should clearly describe the semantic meaning and intended purpose for all properties, to assist producers in populating this data with values that drive effective consumption.</li>
<li>SARIF defines a range of data that shall be expressed in order to best support static analysis tooling. The specification describes a JSON implementation of this standard. It should be possible to define other implementations (such as XML).</li>
<li>SARIF is designed for static analysis tools and any concept that generally applies for this scenario shall be considered for the format. SARIF can clearly be used for many dynamic analysis scenarios and we should consider augmenting the format for this class of tooling, but not in cases where what is proposed is applicable to the dynamic analysis domain only.</li>
<li>SARIF is domain-agnostic; that is, it does not contain objects or properties that are specific to a single domain, such as security or compliance. However, SARIF might define specific values for properties that are specific to a single domain. For example, the proposed result.taxonomies property might define a dictionary entry whose key invokes a standard classification for memory safety issues only.</li>
<li>The SARIF design is focused on expressing results as produced by a tool at a specific point-in-time and current excludes detailed thinking related to results management (associated result work item, false positive evaluation, etc.). These concepts may be addressed by defining or proposing 'profiles' that broaden SARIF's design surface area, contingent on progress with core work.</li>
</ol>
</blockquote>
<p>Stefan: (end of cited document)</p>
<p>Laurence: suggests shifting perspective from principles of first implementation towards principles of which perspectives to approach in which version of the format (some important topics later, not in version say initial, restricted); he does not want to shut down discussion, but preserve the thrust</p>
<p>Michael: agrees that this is important to name and think through the most important domains the members contribute (like formerly discussed with Paul); so that we have some thoughts on how to proceed when those domains will be applied (possibly in later versions)</p>
<p>David: asks if there is other discussion</p>
<p>David: further asks, what is the preferred way of carrying forward with these seven points?</p>
<p><b>Stefan</b> I <b>move</b> we follow the seven guiding principles. <b>Laurence</b> seconds.</p>
<p>David: No discussion, no objections, the motion carries</p>

<h2 id="8">8. Begin document review</h2>
<p>URL: <a href="https://www.oasis-open.org/committees/download.php/61618/sarif-v1.0-wd01.docx" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">https://www.oasis-open.org/committees/download.php/61618/sarif-v1.0-wd01.docx</a></p>
<h3 id="8.1">8.1 Review five issues as amended</h3>
<h4 id="8.1.1">8.1.1 Issue #27 - Add help property to a rule <a href="https://github.com/oasis-tcs/sarif-spec/issues/27" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">https://github.com/oasis-tcs/sarif-spec/issues/27</a></h4>
<p>Luke: is in favour of the proposal of issue#27</p>
<p>Laurence: agrees with Michael, that markdown and html and of course text are good formats for this, but of course all need security and dialect guards enabled</p>
<p>Jim: agrees with the security concerns of html esp. w.r.t. embedding fragments, and thus advises against it, but agrees with using text and markdown if dialects/flavours are chosen/clear</p>
<p>Laurence: asks, if someone is willing to take an action to select a safe and widely used flavour of markdown?
<p>Ken: suggests maybe github?</p>
<p>Laurence: There is this issue: <a href="https://github.com/github/markup/issues/245" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">https://github.com/github/markup/issues/245</a></p>
<p>Laurence: volunteers to investigate</p>

<h4 id="8.1.2">8.1.2 Issue #14 - Should we allow file identity to be specified by reference to a commit... " <a href="https://github.com/oasis-tcs/sarif-spec/issues/14" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">https://github.com/oasis-tcs/sarif-spec/issues/14</a></h4>
<p>Luke: asks, if this is file level info?</p>
<p>Michael: states, maybe yes, but there might be mixed situations</p>
<p>All discuss multiplicity/dimension of entries/properties</p>
<p>Jim: suggests maybe a map of repos including a default?</p>
<p>Jim: adds, that git can nest repositories, so a structure should be able to map that into our structures</p>
<p>Michael: agrees, that the main intended use case, is fetch the file to be able to overlay results (display association)</p>
<p>Jim and Michael: come to agreement on how to proceed in this regard</p>
<p>Laurence: asks, if someone will take an action to actually amend the issue with our findings/results?</p>
<p>Michael: will take this action item, if not someone else on the call will want to do this?</p>
<p>Michael takes this action</p>

<h4 id="8.1.3">8.1.3 Issue #33 - Should we allow formatting in messages? <a href="https://github.com/oasis-tcs/sarif-spec/issues/33" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">https://github.com/oasis-tcs/sarif-spec/issues/33</a></h4>
<p>Luke: mentions, that we may want to add links and then also to make them understandable in the markdown for the consumer</p>
<p>Michael: agrees entirely</p>
<p>Luke and Michael: both think in terms of published micro format for this</p>
<p>All discuss if there is prior art or proven way to construct such a microformat</p>
<p>Luke: suggests use cases and round trip navigation experiences enabled by the Semmle products</p>
<p>All discuss further details on html element level ...</p>
<p>Michael: takes the action to compare a couple of embedding strategies for those location info relating also to cross referencing (Paul is in favour)</p>

<h4 id="8.1.4">8.1.4 Issue #15 - Document how converters should provide notifications <a href="https://github.com/oasis-tcs/sarif-spec/issues/15" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">https://github.com/oasis-tcs/sarif-spec/issues/15</a></h4>
<p>Laurence: suggests, the IDs themselves encode the source context (partially)</p>
<p>All discuss about the issue - adding historical context</p>
<p>Jim: suggests adding provenance</p>
<p>Michael: asks if Jim encountered in SWAMP situations where this would have been useful?</p>
<p>Jim: states, that yes! Example errors during execution, he would like to be able offering partial results to the customers (which currently complain, that there are none)</p>
<p>Michael: likes this and imagines we can add to this issue</p>
<p>Michael: thinks that IDs might be enriched with target semantics like number of processors used while encountering some error</p>

<h4 id="8.1.5">8.1.5 Issue #10 - Do we want an array of computedFingerprints on result? <a href="https://github.com/oasis-tcs/sarif-spec/issues/10" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">https://github.com/oasis-tcs/sarif-spec/issues/10</a></h4>
<p>Luke: informs, that Semmle products do fingerprinting via  region matching, and sink only might not suffice</p>
<p>All discuss on generalisations of changes based on region addressing</p>
<p>Michael: thinks that this is an interesting extension of the currently considered model of fingerprint application</p>
<p>Michael: understands 1) there could be different methods for fingerprinting (the issue) but also 2) also any location contributing to the result might ...</p>
<p>Michael: asks how do the correlations among regions are made in practice? ... in such an array.</p>
<p>Laurence: Association of the fingerprint is currently on the result</p>
<p>Michael: understands the proposal from Luke to put the fingerprint on the location</p>
<p>Yekaterina: explains the way their products generate the hash/number related to the results (complicated formula) - in the end it is just a number associated per result</p>
<p>All continue discussion rigidness vs. flexibility of the fingerprinting that lead to the current idea of fingerprints in SARIF draft</p>
<p>Paul: reports, that their tool does such a fingerprinting based summary but he adds that fingerprints are kind of pristine that is not changeable, so some tool error situation some backup data structure might be helpful to provide some plan b provisioning of info in case the first try fingerprint association does fail</p>
<p>All continue discussing the issue</p>
<p>David: reminds of the time</p>
<p>Jim: agrees that the fingerprint is tool specific, it should relate to the result, it might be useful to have a dictionary as there might be more than one, maybe also suggest a version ordering with rules one could use to base decisions on.</p>
<p>Michael: will add these inputs to the issues</p>
<p>All agree, that it is not yet clear how we will exactly proceed: Offer one or more fingerprints is not decided yet.</p>
