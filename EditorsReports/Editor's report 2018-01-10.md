# Editor's report

Laurence J. Golding and Michael Fanning

Presented at TC Meeting #8, January 10, 2018

1. After being approved at the last TC meeting (#7), the spec changes for the following issues were merged into the provisional draft:

    1. Issue [#25](https://github.com/oasis-tcs/sarif-spec/issues/25): "One of result.{message,formattedRuleMessage} is required"

    2. Issue [#27](https://github.com/oasis-tcs/sarif-spec/issues/27): "Add a help property to rule"

    3. Issue [#56](https://github.com/oasis-tcs/sarif-spec/issues/27): "Consider adding namespaces to tags"
    
2. The formal spec language for the following issues was made available for review on January 4th, 2018, and we will move for their adoption in today's meeting:

    1. Issue [#33](https://github.com/oasis-tcs/sarif-spec/issues/33): "Should we allow formatting in messages?"

    2. Issue [#61](https://github.com/oasis-tcs/sarif-spec/issues/61): "Consider specifying a format for links embedded in our plain text messages."

    3. Issue [#69](https://github.com/oasis-tcs/sarif-spec/issues/69): "Consider providing a physicalLocation on a stackFrame"

    4. Issue [#72](https://github.com/oasis-tcs/sarif-spec/issues/72): "run.lang property needs a default value"

    A single change draft includes the changes for all four issues:

    Documents/ChangeDrafts/sarif-v1.0-issues-33-61-69-72.docx

3. That same draft includes a small set of clarifications and editorial changes, and we will move for their adoption at today's meeting as well.

4. The formal spec language for the following issue, which the previous Editor's Report said would be ready for approval at this meeting, was postponed because the issue is still under discussion:

    1. Issue [#58](https://github.com/oasis-tcs/sarif-spec/issues/58): Consider adding 'rank' or 'probability' property

5. We plan to make purely editorial changes to address the following issues for the next TC meeting:

    1. Issue [#65](https://github.com/oasis-tcs/sarif-spec/issues/65): Ensure all syntax specifications are in EBNF
    
    2. Issue [#73](https://github.com/oasis-tcs/sarif-spec/issues/73): Alphabetize terms
